# DeAMX
DeAMX - .amx files decompiler for SA:MP originally made by trc_ in 2008

----------------------

I am just updating it in my free times.

----------------------

# What's New? :
- Added all SA:MP functions till 0.3.7.
- Added new type of vars. (e.g: PlayerText, Text3D, PlayerText3D and etc..)
- Added all SA:MP callbacks till 0.3.7.
- Fixed the bug with callback parameters and usage of it in callback.
  (e.g: cmdtext should be cmdtext[] as a parameter of callback OnPlayerCommandText or Float:amount in OnPlayer(Take/Give)Damge. )
- Fixed the bug with returning right type of variable.  

----------------------

# To Do:
- Adding some famous includes like streamer, sscanf and etc.
